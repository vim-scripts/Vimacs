						*vimacs-win32-quickstart*

Firstly, you'll need Vim 6 installed.  Vimacs won't work on older
versions.

To install Vimacs, copy the .txt file in the archive to your Vim
documentation directory (typically "C:\Program Files\vim\vimfiles\doc"),
and copy the .vim file to your plugin directory (typically "C:\Program
Files\vim\vimfiles\plugin").

See the |vimacs-installation| topic in the main Vimacs help file for full
information.
